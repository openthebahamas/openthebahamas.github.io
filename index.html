<h1>Join us for a beach walk, on Sunday September 6th at 9:45 AM at Goodman's Bay Park, in protest over the beach closures in The Bahamas</h1>
<p>&quot;My fellows Bahamians and residents,&quot;</p>
<p>Today, Monday August 31th, 2020, I saw families on our wonderful beaches on New Providence. They swam, played and enjoyed the morning. What's special about it? It was 8:45 AM. Why is this important? Because the latest &quot;order&quot; from our government requires them to use the beaches only until 9 AM.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-believe">WHAT WE BELIEVE</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We believe closing our wonderful beaches is killing our economy. God gave us the most beautiful beaches on the planet. They are fuel for our economy. Closing the beaches in The Bahamas is exactly as closing the oil wells in Saudi Arabia.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe we have the right to go where we want while we do not harm anybody. Our constitution says: &quot;Art. 25 (1) Except with his consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of movement, and for the purposes of this Article the said freedom means the right to move freely throughout The Bahamas [...]&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that there is nothing related to public health that suggests to close the beaches. The virus is destroyed by sunlight. It is far better to spend a day on the beach than to stay in your home or office.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that no one has the authority to forbid us from entering a public beach, taking a bath, and enjoying our beautiful islands.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-we-will-do">WHAT WE WILL DO</h2>
<p><em>We will meet on Sunday September 6th at 9:45 AM at Goodman's Bay Park, east entrance. At 10 AM we will ENTER THE BEACH. We will walk along the beach to the west, and then return to the east entrance. There we will take a swim in the sea. If nobody stops us, we'll spend our Sunday at the beach.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-to-be-aware-of">WHAT TO BE AWARE OF</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Our walk to the beach is against the law. The Emergency Powers (Covid 19 Pandemic)(No. 4) Order 2020 states that &quot;all public and private beaches [...] shall be open daily, in New Providence, between the hours of 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM&quot;. Our event starts at 9:45 AM and we will enter the beach at 10 AM.</p></li>
<li><p>We will maintain social distance throughout the duration of the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring a printed copy of this document with you at any time. If somebody asks you to leave the beach, you will show this document. You have the constitutional right to peacefully protest. This document shows to anybody that you are standing for your rights.</p></li>
<li><p>We are not linked in any way to any existing political movement. We just want to get back our freedoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring kids and families to the event. Not because we will use their presence for any political agenda (we are not), but because they have a constitutional right to enjoy our beaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone is welcome to join, as long as they do not show or wear any political sign or logo.</p></li>
<li><p>No one will make any public statements to the media on our behalf. This document is the only source of information about the protest. It will be amended with updates on our website <a href="https://openthebahamas.github.io" class="uri">https://openthebahamas.github.io</a>. If you want to send suggestions or comments, you can do so by send an email to <a href="mailto:openthebahamas@pm.me">mailto:openthebahamas@pm.me</a></p></li>
<li><p>Please share this document like there's no tomorrow.</p></li>
